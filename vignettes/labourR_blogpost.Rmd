To assist research on the labour market, [ESCO](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home) has defined a taxonomy for occupations. Occupations are specified and organized in a hierarchical structure based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). `labourR` is a new package that performs occupations coding for multilingual free-form text (e.g. a job title) using the ESCO hierarchical classification model.

The initial motivation was to retrieve the work experience history from a Curriculum Vitae for the purpose of statistical analysis of data from the Europass online CV editor. In the approach followed, the first step is to generate the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency numerical statistic for each term found in the ESCO occupations corpus. Then, the input query receives a score for each ESCO occupation based on the matched terms found on the ESCO vocabulary. Given an ISCO level, the classification is performed by a plurality vote in the corresponding hierarchical level of the ESCO ontologies with the highest score. 

The `labourR` package:

- Includes the ESCO corpus and the respective ESCO to ISCO mappings.

- Allows a user to enter multilingual free-form text and receive its classification in the ESCO-ISCO hierarchy.

- Computations are fully vectorized and memory efficient.

- Includes facilities to assist research in text mining of labour market data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of labourR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with,

``` r
install.packages("labourR")
```

## Examples

```{r example}
library(labourR)
corpus <- data.frame(
  id = 1:3,
  text = c("Data Scientist", "Junior Architect Engineer", "Cashier at McDonald's")
)
```

For a given ISCO hierarchical level, the top suggested ISCO group is returned. `num_leaves` specifies the number of ESCO occupations used by the classifier to perform a plurality vote,

```{r with_isco_level}
classify_occupation(corpus = corpus, isco_level = 3, isco_given = isco_given, lang = "en", num_leaves = 5)
```
